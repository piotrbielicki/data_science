    Complete the function header by supplying the parameter for a DataFrame df and the parameter col_name with a default value of 'lang' for the DataFrame column name.
    Call count_entries() by passing the tweets_df DataFrame and the column name 'lang'. Assign the result to result1. Note that since 'lang' is the default value of the col_name parameter, you don't have to specify it here.
    Call count_entries() by passing the tweets_df DataFrame and the column name 'source'. Assign the result to result2.
